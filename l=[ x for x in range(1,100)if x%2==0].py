# Create a list 'l' using list comprehension. 
# This list comprehension iterates over a range of numbers from 1 to 9,999,999 (inclusive).
l = [x for x in range(1, 10000000)]

# Print the list 'l'.
# Note: Printing such a large list will generate a massive amount of output and is generally not practical.
