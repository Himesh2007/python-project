# Define a list of fruits
l = ["cherry", "grapes", "banana", "apple", "mango"]  # List containing names of fruits

# Uncommenting and completing the variable definitions for tuple, set, and dictionary
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Tuple containing integers from 1 to 5
s = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # Set containing integers from 1 to 5
d = {"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964}  # Dictionary with car details

# Example variable assignment
a = l  # Assigning the list l to variable a

# Print the variable a to show its content
print(a)  # Output will be ['cherry', 'grapes', 'banana', 'apple', 'mango']
